# Blog Application (Temporary name, will change it later)

This is a full stack application which I will be building
There are lots of cool feature I am thinking to add

### some of them are

- admin can add post with images and can perform CRUD operation on their post
- user profile will be created
- user can follow some other bloggers
- they will be shown blogs recommendations
- users can comment on the another user blog and its own obviously
- user can like the blog and like will be shown in real time with the help of web socket protocols
- mongodb and sql both type of database I will be using
- user can bookmark can see them later.
- number of reads will be counted (based on the time spend on an article)

## more feature will come on this as I will implement it.
